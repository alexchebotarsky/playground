# Christmas Song

This is a simple challenge of printing lyrics to the Christmas carol “The Twelve Days of Christmas”, while taking advantage of the repetition in the song.

> For additional complexity I extended the challenge by making functions for writing out numbers as their full English written form and using them. See `writeout` package.
